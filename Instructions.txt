Fruit Detection & Classification

- Run object_detection.bat to see the output images
- You may change the value of the number of images in the bat file (max 25)

- You will probably need to build the solution first as the bat file needs to 
	run the executable from the /x64/debug/ folder
- All items included in this zip folder need to be in the solution folder 
	(FinalProject/FinalProject/) in order to run properly
